### What I learned

Overall, this challenge was a piece of cake, since it only tests the fundementals of front end. Though, the hardest challenge I face is to make it responsive. Through testing the responsiveness of the page in various browser sizes and making any necessary changes, I was able to successfully overcome my struggle. It was a fun project and I learned how to use different width and height units, as long as the max-width property.

### Continued development

I will learn more properties and technique that I could make a website more responsive through YouTube videos and webpages. It will make me better and more comfortable in making a page responsive effortlessly and effectively.
